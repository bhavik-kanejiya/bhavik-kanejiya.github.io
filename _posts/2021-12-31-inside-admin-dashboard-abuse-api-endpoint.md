## Introduction to application:

It's basically Productivity app which has over 2 million+ users which basically used by businesses to track employee project time and expense.

## How does Application works?

A User can join multiple workspace from one account but User ID will be same across all the work spaces. So, User created his/her personal workspace and joined company's workspace too.

The API pass the Workspace ID to interact with application.

> While test for role based broken access control, Use Multi account containers Where Cookies are separated by container, allowing us to use the web with multiple accounts.

There are few sections which are only visible to admin. On User side we have limited functionalities. If We change the workspace ID directly, It will redirect me to it's homepage. We use ***Burp's match and replace*** feature to replace Workspace ID.


This is the final result when User successfully match and replace Personal Workspace ID with company's Workspace ID.
