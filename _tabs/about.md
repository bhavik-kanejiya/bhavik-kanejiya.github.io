<h2><b>Hey I'm Bhavik!</b></h2>

I have experience in web application penetration testing. My area of interest includes Web Application security, API security and Cloud Computing.

I love to break application and in free time love to read books. And yaah that's all about me...


<h2><b>Let's get in touch!</b></h2>

If you'd like to talk, suggest or give me feedback of any kind, I'll be delighted to hear from you. 

I'm hanging out a lot on <a href="https://twitter.com/bhavik_kanejiya">twitter</a>, and will answer all your questions through a DM if that is more practical for you!
